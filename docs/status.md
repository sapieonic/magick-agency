# Status

Where Magick Agency stands, in detail: what each delivery phase built and the evidence for it,
the last test counts, what is not built, what is still open and with whom, the deployment
invariants, and what to do next. Read it before planning work on the repo, or before answering
"is it done". As of 2026-10-17.

## Summary

The application is built: phases 1 to 9 of the delivery plan
([`intent-and-plan.md`](intent-and-plan.md)) are complete on the code side, every suite is green,
and Manas's rulings on the open questions are implemented. Nothing has yet run against a real
carrier, a real Firebase sign-in, production data or a deployed environment. The launch (phase
10) and the gated checks that need vendor accounts or real data are still to do.

## Phases

| Phase | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Vendor setup and decisions | **Not done** (needs Manas) | No vendor accounts requested; launch decisions built with defaults ([`decisions.md`](decisions.md), §2) |
| 1 Scaffold | Done | Monorepo, CI, dev infra on 5436 / 6383 / 3021 / 5175 / 5176, Zod config that exits on invalid input. Dashboards and alerts deferred (B6) |
| 2 Contracts and schema | Done | `packages/contracts`; the baseline migration `packages/db/migrations/0001_baseline.sql`, inventoried in `packages/db/BASELINE.md`; baseline integration suite including down→up and trigger firing |
| 3 Platform layer | Done | Session sign-in paths and the `no_membership` refusal, invites, RBAC, settings, flags, super-admin, notifications, audit, usage counts; a 45-case invite escalation suite |
| 4 Dialer domain and data | Done | Pure rules in `packages/domain`; the agency repository and campaign management; repository tests on real Postgres |
| 5 Voice engine | Done, except the live-carrier check | Bridge, VoiceLink adapter, concurrency guard, sweeps, the carrier fixture test. Not done: one real call on a VoiceLink sandbox (needs the account) |
| 6 Dialer runtime | Done | 9 chaos suites (`apps/server/test/integration/agency/chaos/`); `runtime-e2e` (real app, station socket, real bridge, fake carrier); `runtime-boot-order` |
| 7 Call analysis | Done, except the real-recording check | Runner skip / resume / truncation / backoff tests; transcripts nulled at the retention day. Not done: one real recording analysed (needs vendor keys) |
| 8 Public API | Done | Route-table tests enumerated from Fastify's `onRoute` hook cover every console and super-admin path |
| 9 UIs, parity and dark pilot | UIs done; the rest needs Manas | Console and super-admin console with tests. Not done: Playwright happy path (real Firebase), parity check against production data, dark pilot |
| Rulings | Done | Open-question rulings and branding (`decisions.md` Q1–Q9, B17), each mutation-checked |
| 10 Launch | **Not started** | See "Not built" |

### Plivo, on tenants' own accounts (B18–B22)

Plivo joins VoiceLink as a carrier, dialled on each tenant's OWN Plivo account with credentials
super-admins add (not env). Built in steps:

| Step | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Carrier modules | Done | The bridge asks a per-carrier module (media protocol, hangup style) instead of `provider === 'voicelink'`; `carrier-modules.test.ts`, mutation-checked against the bridge suites |
| 2 Credential store | Done | Migration `0002_telephony_credentials.sql`; envelope sealer and env keyring; credential service and `getForCredentialId`; super-admin API and Telephony Credentials screen; unit tests and a real-Postgres repository suite, guards mutation-checked |
| 3 Plivo adapter | Not started | Dial (`request_uuid`), answer XML with `<Stream>`, μ-law media, cancel vs hangup by id, V3 webhook signatures checked against the pinned credential, `time_limit` on every dial, per-credential calls-per-second limit, recording fetch on per-provider hosts |
| 4 Dialler integration | Not started | Campaigns pin a credential; caller IDs limited to the credential's synced numbers; pause on carrier 401; `plivo` concurrency allocations; activate the `plivo` provider row (seeded inactive by 0002). Obligations the step-2 code leaves to this step: dial through `getForCredentialId(provider, id, 'dial', tenantId)`; insert the call row in a statement that re-checks the credential is `active` (revoke and shred lock the credential row, which waits out an insert in flight but cannot stop one that starts after them); pin a campaign only to an `active` credential; a metric and alert for missing keyring ids and failed sweeps (today they are ERROR/WARN logs); persist the dial's `providerRequestId` (Plivo `request_uuid`) to `provider_request_id` and the session, and give the hangup a way to cancel by it: `TelephonyProvider.endCall` takes only `providerCallId`, and `hangupProviderLeg` returns without a carrier call when that is empty, so a pre-answer teardown of a Plivo call does not reach the carrier today |
| 5 Live check | Not started | One real Plivo call and one recording analysed (needs a Plivo account) |

### Tidy-up 2026-10-16/17

Manas asked on 2026-10-16 for the whole tidy-up plan to be implemented. Decisions and the
defaults still to ratify are in [`decisions.md`](decisions.md), "Rulings of 2026-10-16/17
(tidy-up)", and B23.

| Area | What changed |
|---|---|
| Shared UI | New package `packages/web-ui` (B23): the 15 shared components, `ToastContext`, `global.css`, error and format helpers, `parseApiErrorBody`, `useAsyncResource`, `useDialogFocus` (one focus trap), `mapWithConcurrency`; both SPAs import it, `docker/web.Dockerfile` copies it, and it has its own branding guard |
| Contracts | Dialer contract split into `packages/contracts/src/agency/` behind `agency.ts`; console wire types re-export or derive from it; one `AGENCY_STATION_CLOSE`; campaign config defaults and both rate floors moved in; `AGENCY_STATION_ERROR_CODES`, `api/platform/audit.ts` and the `zod` dependency removed |
| Database | Migration `0003_agency_attempt_indexes.sql` (live-attempt predicate, answered and connected partial indexes, the redundant reporting index dropped; plans in `packages/db/BASELINE.md`); migration `0004_agency_contacts_in_flight_index.sql` (partial index on `in_flight` contacts for the reaper's stranded-contact sweep); `withTransaction` in `packages/db/src/utils/transaction.ts`; batch claims and sweeps through a `MATERIALIZED` CTE (below) |
| Server, agency | The agency repository split into `apps/server/src/db/repositories/agency/` behind the `agency.repository.ts` barrel; `pacing-engine.ts`, `agency-dialer.ts` and `agent-record.ts` split into `pacing/`, `dialer/` and `agent-record/`; pacing `stop()` awaits ticks in flight (5 s bound) and the dialer re-checks just before the carrier; settle paths survive a failed row write, and the reaper recovers what such a write leaves (an attempt whose `ended` write failed is ended `orphaned`; a contact stranded `in_flight` with no live attempt for 5 min is requeued on the our-fault ledger); the pre-dial checks run before the attempt is stamped `dialing`; ingest totals exact under concurrent chunks; one `dialedAt` instant |
| Server, API | Route families (`<family>.routes.ts` plus `<family>/`), shared helpers in `api/routes/helpers/`; `forwardCore` / `forwardCoreVia` in `core-dispatch.ts`; the proven-campaign fast path for the spine export; internal `GET /agency-campaigns/summaries` for the staffing `my-*` routes |
| Server, voice | `webrtc-bridge-manager.ts` split into `core/bridge/` (admission, types, WS tokens); the unstored-token memo capped at 10 000 |
| Console | Large pages, hooks and utils split into folders (campaign detail, campaigns home, station, analytics, roster, overview, config form); one display locale `en-IN` and one rounding rule on the analytics surfaces; a typed `EventCatalog` for analytics; `useTeam` / `useAccounts` / `usePhoneNumbers` on `useAsyncResource` |
| Super-admin | Error messages in the console's order; phone numbers filtered client-side; accounts list reports `unavailable` on a failed allocation read; role enum in `ROLES` order |

**A pre-existing bug, found and fixed.** The batch claims and sweeps (`claimDialable`,
`failStaleActive`, `claimRunnable`, `recoverStale`, `promoteRecordingReady`) could claim far more
than `limit`: under a nested-loop semi-join plan Postgres re-ran the locking subquery and claimed
the whole eligible set, which in the dialer meant dials with no agent and
`agency:agent:undefined:state` leases. Each now picks its rows in a `MATERIALIZED` CTE
(`fix(db): batch claims and sweeps take at most limit rows`), with tests that force the
re-running plan (`apps/server/test/integration/agency/agency-contact-claim-limit.test.ts`,
`packages/db/test/integration/repositories/claim-limit.test.ts`).

**Skipped, with the reason:**

- Pacing reading agent states only after headroom: the `no_agents` vs `no_slots` telemetry needs
  the reads.
- Caching `getMaxConcurrentCalls`: it would defeat cross-replica invalidation.
- Throttling `countOutstanding`: it changes which tick finalizes.
- One per-campaign `LeadState` map in pacing: the collections have different lifetimes.
- Splitting the bridge's media relay, carrier events and teardown, and pacing's `maybeFinalize`:
  bound to private state.
- A raw passthrough in `callCore`: it would bypass the content-type and error-mask handling.
- A streaming CSV export: the headers and preamble need the final row count.
- The campaigns home's per-campaign `/stats` N+1: needs a batch stats contract.
- Migrating the 114 `trackX` call sites to `track<K>()`.
- The super-admin `FlagDialog`'s own focus trap, and the 4-state analytics hooks' own generation
  guards.
- Console list hooks other than `useTeam`, `useAccounts` and `usePhoneNumbers` (now on
  `useAsyncResource`).

**Follow-ups:**

- The T-L4c lease guard's literal-TTL regex (`\b'PX'`, in
  `apps/server/test/integration/agency/chaos/lease-renewer-killed.test.ts`) never matches: `\b`
  before a quote needs a word character in front of it.
- Raw `BEGIN` sites could adopt `withTransaction`: in `packages/db`, the call-analysis-profile
  and membership repositories (and others: provider concurrency, tenant phone assignment,
  dialer analysis jobs, telephony credentials), and in the server the mark-DNC route and audit
  partition maintenance. Only the helper's sites and the membership repository destroy a client
  whose ROLLBACK failed.
- The agency repository still imports runtime values from `apps/server/src/agency/agent-record.ts`.
- Stale comments citing `useBrowserCall` / `useWebRtcCall` in `useAudioCapture`,
  `useAgencyAudio` and `agencyMedia`.
- The reader's default locale remains on the station, activity, spine, retry, notes, ingest,
  builder, contacts and attempts pages and in `AgencyRetryDialog`.
- `AgentBucketChart`'s title reads "1 dials".
- A `released` that lands before React renders its `reserved` does not retain the panel (latent,
  unchanged).

## Test counts

Latest run, 2026-10-17, after the tidy-up, from inside each package:

| Package | Unit | Integration |

| `apps/super-admin` | 421 | — |
| `grafana` (`pnpm test:grafana`) | 31 | — |

`pnpm lint`: clean in 8 packages.

Earlier runs follow, oldest first.

Final full run on 2026-10-09, after `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, from inside each package.

| Package | Lint | Unit | Integration | Build |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `apps/server` | clean | 6412 (302 files)¹ | 1172 (105 files) | OK |
| `packages/db` | clean | 409 | 417 | — |
| `packages/domain` | clean | 50 | — | — |
| `packages/contracts` | clean | 73 | — | — |
| `packages/observability` | clean | 14 | — | — |
| `apps/console` | clean | 4367 (218 files) | — | OK |
| `apps/super-admin` | clean | 366 (24 files) | — | OK |

¹ 6350 in 298 files, plus the self-containment guard's 32
(`apps/server/test/unit/branding/no-external-references.test.ts`) and the production packaging's
30: 6 decoder-packaging tests (`apps/server/test/unit/audio/decoder-toolchain-packaging.test.ts`)
and 24 deployment tests (`apps/server/test/unit/deploy/`).

Unit re-run on 2026-10-10, after the AI client layer, audio analysis, the wizard's recording box
and the S3 Terraform: lint clean in 7 packages; `apps/server` 6507 (307 files); `apps/console` 4374
(218 files); `apps/super-admin` 366; `packages/db` 409; `packages/contracts` 73;
`packages/domain` 50; `packages/observability` 14. Integration and build were not re-run then,
apart from the pipeline and runtime-e2e integration files.

Re-run on 2026-10-11, after the brand logo and favicon (B17 amended): `apps/console` lint clean,
4389 unit (218 files), build OK; `apps/super-admin` lint clean, 374 unit (26 files), build OK.

Re-run on 2026-10-11, after the campaigns landing page redesign and reading the campaign list
past its first page (analytics): `apps/console` lint clean, 4433 unit (221 files), build OK.

Re-run on 2026-10-11, after the campaign list's `status` filter (the campaigns home reads every
active campaign, however old): `apps/console` lint clean, 4440 unit (221 files); `apps/server`
lint clean, 6512 of 6513 unit (308 files), the one failure being the branding guard reading an
uncommitted local file; integration re-run for `repository-sql-coverage.test.ts` only (12).

Re-run on 2026-10-11, after Plivo steps 1–2 and the credential review fixes (shred hold, verify
races, `peek`, uncached providers, keyboard-reachable credential rows): lint clean in 7 packages;
unit `apps/server` 6627 + 42 skipped (314 files), `packages/db` 410 (24 files),
`packages/contracts` 74, `apps/super-admin` 392 (27 files); integration `packages/db` 448
(39 files); `apps/server` integration lanes `rest` 1162 (103 files) and `wall-clock` 11 (2 files).
Two of three local `rest` runs failed 3 cases of `agency-double-reservation.test.ts` (two dials per
pacing tick instead of one); the file passes alone (10 of 10 runs) and the third full run passed,
so the failure depends on file order and is not yet explained.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, unit and build in one job, and the integration suites
in three parallel jobs (db, server, server wall-clock lane), each against its own Postgres 16 and
Redis 7 service containers on the same ports. Per-module test
files are listed in [`modules.md`](modules.md).

## Not built

**Launch work** (phase 10):

- Importing existing tenants and their data from the previous platform: gate queries (no running
  campaigns, no live attempts, sessions left, wrap-ups closed, DNC changes drained) and copy
  scripts that keep ids, so users sign in unchanged.
- The rollback-window DNC mirror back to the previous platform. Only the `agency_dnc_outbox` table
  exists; nothing writes it.
- The link from the previous platform's UI to Magick Agency.
- Applying agency's alert rules and dashboard (`grafana/`, B6) to Grafana Cloud: written and
  validated, never applied. The first `terraform apply` is in `grafana/README.md`.

**Deployment pieces:**

- **OpenTelemetry export is built but has not run against Grafana Cloud.** The SDK
  (`apps/server/src/instrumentation.ts`) pushes traces, metrics and logs over OTLP when
  `OTEL_ENABLED=true`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` are set; it was
  checked end to end against a local OTLP collector only.

**Out of scope:** metering and billing; AI calling; bring-your-own SIP and carriers other than VoiceLink and Plivo (B18); a
separate identity layer.

## Open decisions and owners

The full list is [`decisions.md`](decisions.md), §5. In short, all with Manas:

| Item | What is needed |
|---|---|
| `supervisor_hold` | Declared, never produced. Keep, remove or build |
| Shutdown grace | Ratify `stop_grace_period: 45s`, now in `docker/docker-compose.prod.yml` (the completion-email drain is 30 s; Docker's default grace is 10 s), and the new wait for in-flight pacing ticks (5 s bound) |
| Tidy-up defaults | Ratify the **default, pending Manas** rows of the 2026-10-16/17 rulings, including the `en-IN` display locale and the rounding rule |
| Rate floors | Campaign rates withheld under 25 dials, agent rates under 20: one number or two? |
| Launch defaults | Ratify: re-issue invites; inbound calls play a message and hang up; abandon clip upload-only; no API keys; super-admins created fresh |
| Launch open items | Existing numbers; launch style; domain, feature freeze, rollback window |
| Q3 contract choices | Ratify the five |
| B15 roster supersede | Build it, or leave replace and clear refused |
| Gated items | Vendor setup; Playwright happy path; parity check; dark pilot; real VoiceLink call and recording; launch |
| Metric export | Grafana Cloud's OTLP gateway is the assumed destination; confirm it and issue the token |

## Deployment invariants

Properties the running system needs that the code cannot enforce on its own. Config details are
in [`operations.md`](operations.md).

1. **Redis keeps keys for their TTL.** Persistence on (AOF or RDB) and `maxmemory-policy
   noeviction` (or a `volatile-*` policy with nothing else competing). Call tokens are verified
   against Redis; a token lost early is refused, which cuts a live call's carrier leg (Q6).
2. **Single replica.** The unstored-token memo is in-process (Q6), the dialer runtime has one
   replica id, and several sweeps assume one process.
3. **Exactly `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` proxies in front.** The server must not be reachable except
   through them, or `X-Forwarded-For` spoofing defeats the IP rate limits (Q9).
4. **Postgres TLS** is on only when `NODE_ENV=production`, and then the certificate is verified
   unless `DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false` (Q1).
5. **Migrations run before the server starts.** The image's entrypoint does this on every start
   (`dist/migrate.js`, with the server's TLS settings); outside the image, `pnpm migrate:up`.
6. **Production requires** `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` (boot refuses without it) and the VoiceLink
   fields (config refuses without them).
7. **Stop grace at least 45 s**, or the shutdown's 30 s completion-mail drain is cut
   (`docker/docker-compose.prod.yml` sets it).

The production image and compose file (`docker/`, see [`operations.md`](operations.md)
"Production packaging") write invariants 1–5 and 7 into their headers and enforce what they can:
the server publishes no port, Redis runs with AOF and `noeviction`, the image is
`NODE_ENV=production` and migrates on start, the grace is 45 s.

### Pre-deploy checklist

- [ ] `docker/.env` filled in from `docker/.env.example`, including the console's
      `VITE_FIREBASE_*` build values; values containing `$` or ` #` single-quoted.
- [ ] Redis: persistence on, `noeviction` (the compose file's `redis` does both; an external Redis
      must too). Its volume is backed up or at least survives a host restart.
- [ ] One replica only: never scale `server`.
- [ ] TLS terminator in front of nginx :8080; `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS=2` (terminator + nginx; one more
      per extra proxy in front); :8080 reachable only from the terminator (loopback by default);
      port 3021 not reachable at all (the compose file publishes none).
- [ ] Super-admin :8081: loopback by default (SSH or Session Manager tunnel, or a VPN). If it is
      published through the TLS terminator, on its own domain, IP-allow-listed where possible, and
      with strong passwords on every admin (`DEPLOYMENT.md` 8.4 lists the costs).
- [ ] Host memory: the server may grow to a 4 GB heap (`docker/entrypoint.sh`). On a 4 GB VM (the
      `aws/terraform` default) that is all of the RAM; lower the heap or size up before load.
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production` (the image sets it); `DATABASE_URL` without TLS parameters; `DB_SSL_CA`
      if the database uses a private CA.
- [ ] First boot logs `migrations complete` before `magick-agency listening` (the entrypoint runs
      them; a failure stops the container).
- [ ] Firebase: agency's domain in the authorised domains, `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` set (no service
      account: tokens are verified against Google's public keys).
- [ ] VoiceLink: account, numbers in the super-admin inventory, `VOICELINK_*` set,
      `VOICELINK_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` reachable by the carrier.
- [ ] `SUPER_ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` set; first super-admin created with `node dist/create-super-admin.js`
      inside the server container (`operations.md` "First super-admin").
- [ ] Mailjet sender verified (SPF/DKIM); `MAILJET_*` and `CONSOLE_BASE_URL` set.
- [ ] S3 bucket and keys (`S3_AUDIO_BUCKET`, `AWS_*`) for clips and CSV uploads, applied per
      environment from `aws/terraform` (`aws/README.md`). The same module can create the VM, its
      security group and Elastic IP (`create_server`).
- [ ] Analysis: `DIALER_ANALYSIS_ENABLED`, transcriber and LLM keys, `RECORDING_URL_SIGNING_SECRET`.
- [ ] Container stop grace at least 45 s (`stop_grace_period: 45s` in the compose file; set it
      too on any other runtime).
- [ ] A decision on metric export.

## Recommended next steps, in order

1. **Ratify the decisions** that need no vendors: launch defaults, Q3, `supervisor_hold`, the
   shutdown grace and in-flight tick wait, B15, the tidy-up defaults; settle the rate floors.
2. **Vendor setup**, because it has lead time: agency's VoiceLink account (ask about moving
   existing numbers and recording retention), Firebase authorised domain,
   Mailjet sender and domain, S3 bucket, Gemini / OpenAI keys, domain and TLS, PostHog.
3. **Deployment packaging:** done (`docker/`, see [`operations.md`](operations.md) "Production
   packaging") and the OpenTelemetry SDK. `aws/terraform` provisions the VM too (`create_server`):
   a staging VM exists (2026-10-11, Ubuntu 26.04, 2 vCPU / 4 GB, 20 GB) with Caddy holding a Let's
   Encrypt certificate for its domain. Left: the Grafana Cloud token, and running the stack there
   through `DEPLOYMENT.md` section 9 with the vendor accounts from step 2.
4. **Real-world checks:** one real VoiceLink sandbox call; one real recording analysed; the
   Playwright happy path against real Firebase.
5. **Parity check and dark pilot** on a staging copy and an internal tenant.
6. **Launch:** write and rehearse the import gate queries and copy scripts, the DNC mirror, the
   link from the previous platform and the dashboards, then go live environment by environment.
